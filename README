Records IP for client logins and makes them searchable for WHMCS by KuJoe (JMD.cc)
Slightly edited from Aldryic C'boas initial hook here (and I borrowed the name): https://vpsboard.com/topic/134-whmcs-extended-login-tracking/
Ported from this addon here: http://www.whmcs.com/appstore/52/Search-IP.html

1.1 -	Renamed MySQL table.

//Installation:
1) Create mod_tbllogins table in WHMCS database (query below).
2) Upload the login_tracking.php file into your WHMCS's hooks directory (/includes/hooks/).
2) Upload the search_ip folder into your WHMCS's addons directory (/modules/addons/) and activate the addon in WHMCS.

-- START QUERY
CREATE TABLE mod_tbllogins (clientid INT(10), ip VARCHAR(15), date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
CREATE INDEX idx1 ON mod_tbllogins(clientid); CREATE INDEX idx2 ON mod_tbllogins(ip); CREATE INDEX idx3 ON mod_tbllogins(date);
-- END QUERY

//Upgrading:
Upgrading from version 1.4 and older
1) Run the following MySQL query:

-- START QUERY
RENAME TABLE tbllogins TO mod_tbllogins;
-- END QUERY
